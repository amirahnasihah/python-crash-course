# Chapter 3

In this chapter and the next you’ll learn what lists are and how to start working 
with the elements in a list. Lists allow you to store sets of information in one 
place, whether you have just a few items or millions of items. 
Lists are one of Python’s most powerful features readily acces-sible to new 
programmers, and they tie together many important concepts in programming.

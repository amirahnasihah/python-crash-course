# Chapter 7
### Try it Yourself


7-1. Rental Car: Write a program that asks the user what kind of rental car they
would like. Print a message about that car, such as “Let me see if I can find you
a Subaru.”

7-2. Restaurant Seating: Write a program that asks the user how many people
are in their dinner group. If the answer is more than eight, print a message saying
they’ll have to wait for a table. Otherwise, report that their table is ready.

7-3. Multiples of Ten: Ask the user for a number, and then report whether the
number is a multiple of 10 or not.

7-4. Pizza Toppings: Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of
pizza toppings until they enter a 'quit' value. As they enter each topping,
print a message saying you’ll add that topping to their pizza.

7-5. Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on
a person’s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are
between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is
$15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost
of their movie ticket.

7-6. Three Exits: Write different versions of either Exercise 7-4 or Exercise 7-5
that do each of the following at least once:
• Use a conditional test in the while statement to stop the loop.
• Use an active variable to control how long the loop runs.
• Use a break statement to exit the loop when the user enters a 'quit' value.

7-7. Infinity: Write a loop that never ends, and run it. (To end the loop, press
ctrl-C or close the window displaying the output.)

7-8. Deli: Make a list called sandwich_orders and fill it with the names of various sandwiches. Then make an empty list called finished_sandwiches. Loop
through the list of sandwich orders and print a message for each order, such
as I made your tuna sandwich. As each sandwich is made, move it to the list
of finished sandwiches. After all the sandwiches have been made, print a
message listing each sandwich that was made.

7-9. No Pastrami: Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure
the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code
near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has
run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all occurrences of
'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up
in finished_sandwiches.

7-10. Dream Vacation: Write a program that polls users about their dream vacation.
Write a prompt similar to If you could visit one place in the world, where
would you go? Include a block of code that prints the results of the poll.

# Chapter 8: functions
### Try It Yourself

8-1. Message: Write a function called `display_message()` that prints one sentence telling everyone what you are learning about in this chapter. Call the function, and make sure the message displays correctly.

8-2. Favorite Book: Write a function called `favorite_book()` that accepts one parameter, `title`. The function should print a message, such as `One of my favorite books is Alice in Wonderland.` Call the function, making sure to include a book title as an argument in the function call.

Write a function called `make_shirt()` that accepts a size and the text of a message that should be printed on the shirt. The function should print a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on it.

Call the function once using positional arguments to make a shirt. Call the function a second time using keyword arguments.

Modify the `make_shirt()` function so that shirts are large by default with a message that reads _I love Python._ Make a large shirt and a medium shirt with the default message, and a shirt of any size with a different message.

Write a function called `describe_city()` that accepts the name of a city and its country. The function should print a simple sentence, such as `Reykjavik is in Iceland.` Give the parameter for the country a default value. Call your function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the default country.
